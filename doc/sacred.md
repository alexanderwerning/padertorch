# Running experiments with sacred

[sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred) is a package that simplifies running experiments by

 - collecting important information about the experiment, such as host information, configuration, current git
  state, 
 - storing this information about the experiment on disk or in a database with observers,
 - providing tools to build a configuration, and
 - providing an easy-to-use command line interface.

The documentation for sacred can be found on [readthedocs](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
The [quickstart section](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) gives a good introduction into sacred.
For real-world examples of how to use sacred in a deep-learning context with `padertorch` you can have a look at our
 [examples](padertorch/contrib/examples).
 
## Experiment structure with sacred

Padertorch uses the [`padertorch.Configurable`](configurable.md) for all its components to easily create
 instances from configuration dictionaries.
`sacred` handles the part of creating the configuration dictionaries in an easy and reproducible way.
`sacred` provides a base class for experiments, called `Experiment`, that handles everything related to experiments.
When instantiating, it requires an experiment name:

```python
from sacred import Expeirment

ex = Experiment('my-experiment')
```

The main function is defined with the `@ex.automain` decorator:

```python
from sacred import Expeirment

ex = Experiment('my-experiment')

@ex.automain
def main(...):
    ... # Run your experiment here
```

### Defining the configuration

The experiment object `ex` can then be used to define the configuration of the experiment.
This can be done in different ways:

 - Using **[dicts](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#dictionaries)**: Set the configuration
  directly as a dictionary.
 - Using **[Configuration files](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#config-files)**: Sacred
  supports loading configuration from JSON and yaml files.
 - Using **[ConfigScopes](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#config-scopes)**: ConfigScopes are 
  functions wrapped by sacred with the `config` decorator. All local
  variables in these functions are interpreted as configuration values.
  This enables complex computations, dependencies and automatic filling of missing configuration values.
  This is the recommended way of setting configuration values in the code.
 - Using **[named ConfigScopes](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#named-configurations)**: 
  You can bundle frequently used non-default configuration in config scopes and give
  them a name with the `named_config` decorator. This way you can call your script `with named_config_name` and
  sacred inserts the config.
 - Via the **[command line interface](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#configuration-updates)**:
  You can call your script with the arguments `with configuration_key=value` and
  it automatically updates all configuration values that depend on `configuration_key` and stores information about
  what was modified.

For more information about how sacred handles configuration, have a look at the documentation about 
[the config](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html) and 
[the command line interface](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html).

The configuration for a training experiment could look like the following example.
It contains a config scope (`@ex.config`) and multiple named configs (`@ex.named_config`).
It uses functions from the `Configurable` to fill the configuration with missing arguments.
Have a look at the `Configurable` documentation [here](configurable.md) for more information about the structure
 of the configuration `dict`.

```python
from sacred import Experiment
from sacred.observers import FileStorageObserver
from sacred.commands import print_config
import padertorch as pt
from pathlib import Path

# Define the experiment. Experiment is the main class for managing experiments.
ex = Experiment('my-experiment-name')


class MyModel(pt.Model):
    # Implement your model here
    def __init__(self, num_layers=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_layers = num_layers


# Create a ConfigScope with the config decorator
@ex.config
def config():
    """
    This function contains the configuration of the experiment. All local 
    variables in this function will be captured by sacred and used as 
    configuration values.
    """
    # padertorch.Trainer inherits from Configurable, so we can easily construct 
    # the config dictionary here and instantiate the trainer from the config 
    # later
    trainer = {
        # The 'factory' key tells the Configurable which class to instantiate
        'factory': pt.Trainer,
        # The next line creates a new experiment folder for this experiment
        'storage_dir': None,
        'model': {
            'factory': MyModel, # <-- insert your model class here
            # You can put additional configuration of your model here
        },
        # Here goes additional configuration of the trainer
    }   
    if not trainer['storage_dir'] is None:
        # This finds and creates an unused storage dir relative to the 
        # environment variable $STORAGE_ROOT. It is enclosed in the if statement
        # because otherwise it would create unused folders on resume
        trainer['storage_dir'] = pt.io.get_new_storage_dir(ex.path)
    
    # The following line fills the trainer config with the default arguments of
    # the configurable classes. In this example, it will, for example, insert 
    # the "num_layers" argument from the model.
    pt.Trainer.get_config(trainer)
    
    # This adds an observer to the experiment that stores the collected 
    # information about the experiment. In this case, we use a 
    # FileStorageObserver that writes the information to the filesystem to a 
    # sub-folder of the experiment's storage directory.
    ex.observers.append(FileStorageObserver(
        Path(trainer['storage_dir']) / 'sacred')
    )

@ex.named_config
def large():
    """This is a named config for a large model. This configuration can be 
    activated by calling the script `with large` and it overwrites the default 
    values in the `config` function above."""
    trainer = {
        'model': {
            'num_layers': 5   
        }
    }

@ex.automain
def main(trainer, ...):
    # Create trainer from config (Configurable)
    trainer = pt.Trainer.from_config(trainer)
    ... # Run your experiment here
```

When calling the script, all configuration values can be modified from the command line interface with dotted path
 access.
If you want to set the number of layers of your model in the above example to `3`, you could write:

```shell
$ python experiment.py with trainer.model.num_layers=3
```

### Accessing the configuration

The configuration is stored internally in sacred and is passed to so-called captured functions.
These are functions decorated with `@ex.captured_function`.
When called, the decorator fills the missing arguments of a function with values from the configuration.
For example:

```python
from sacred import Experiment

ex = Experiment('my-experiment')

@ex.config
def config():
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3

@ex.captured_function
def foo(a, b):
    """A captured function. If it is called without arguments, they are filled 
    from the config."""
    print(a, b)

@ex.automain
def main(_config):
    """The main function is also a named config. The special argument `_config`
    contains the whole configuration dict."""
    foo()
    print(_config)
```

### Storing experiment information with sacred observers

A core part of sacred are the so called ["Observers"](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/observers.html) in `sacred.observers`.
Observers keep track of important information and store them in a database (e.g., `sacred.observers.MongoObserver
`) or on the disk (`sacred.observers.FileStorageObserver`).
We recommend using the `FileStorageObserver` because it does not depend on an external server, and the data can
 easily be viewed on the command line.
You can add an `Observer` to an experiment by appending it to the list of observers.
We recommend doing this in a config scope so that you can use configuration values, such as the experiment path, to
 initialize the observer.

```python
from sacred import Experiment
from sacred.observers import FileStorageObserver
from pathlib import Path

ex = Experiment('my-experiment')

@ex.config
def config():
    storage_dir = '/.../...'
    ex.observers.append(FileStorageObserver(Path(storage_dir) / 'sacred'))

@ex.automain
def main(...):
    ...
```

The `FileStorageObserver` stores experiment information in the storage dir with the following structure:

```
.                   # The storage dir you passed to the observer
├── 1               # A Unique ID created by the observer to handle multipe runs in the same storage dir (e.g., resume)
│   ├── config.json     # Configuration of this run
│   ├── cout.txt        # Captured stdout and stderr streams
│   ├── metrics.json    # Reported metrics (not used by the trainer, so this file is typically empty)
│   └── run.json        # Information about the run, such as time, host info, git status, imported packages ...
└── _sources                  # The _sources folder can contain source files that are not checked into git
    └── experiment_<somerandomid>.py
```

You can use the loading functions in `paderbox.io` to look at the stored information.

## Full Example

Consider the following example for a training script using sacred.
This might seem a bit lengthy at the beginning, but the added functionality really pays off.

```python
import sacred
from sacred import Experiment
from sacred.observers import FileStorageObserver
from sacred.commands import print_config
import padertorch as pt
from pathlib import Path

sacred.SETTINGS.CONFIG.READ_ONLY_CONFIG = False  # READ_ONLY causes some strange errors. Disable it.

# Define the experiment. Experiment is the main class for managing experiments.
ex = Experiment('my-experiment-name')


class MyModel(pt.Model):
    # Implement your model here
    def __init__(self, num_layers=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_layers = num_layers


# Create a ConfigScope with the config decorator
@ex.config
def config():
    """
    This function contains the configuration of the experiment. All local 
    variables in this function will be captured by sacred and used as 
    configuration values.
    """
    # padertorch.Trainer inherits from Configurable, so we can easily construct 
    # the config dictionary here and instantiate the trainer from the config 
    # later
    trainer = {
        # The 'factory' key tells the Configurable which class to instantiate
        'factory': pt.Trainer,
        # The next line creates a new experiment folder for this experiment
        'storage_dir': None,
        'model': {
            'factory': MyModel, # <-- insert your model class here
            # You can put additional configuration of your model here
        },
        # Here goes additional configuration of the trainer
    }   
    if not trainer['storage_dir'] is None:
        # This finds and creates an unused storage dir relative to the 
        # environment variable $STORAGE_ROOT. It is enclosed in the if statement
        # because otherwise it would create unused folders on resume
        trainer['storage_dir'] = pt.io.get_new_storage_dir(ex.path)
    
    # The following line fills the trainer config with the default arguments of
    # the configurable classes. In this example, it will, for example, insert 
    # the "num_layers" argument from the model.
    pt.Trainer.get_config(trainer)
    
    # This adds an observer to the experiment that stores the collected 
    # information about the experiment. In this case, we use a 
    # FileStorageObserver that writes the information to the filesystem to a 
    # sub-folder of the experiment's storage directory.
    ex.observers.append(FileStorageObserver(
        Path(trainer['storage_dir']) / 'sacred')
    )

@ex.named_config
def large():
    """This is a named config for a large model. This configuration can be 
    activated by calling the script `with large` and it overwrites the default 
    values in the `config` function above."""
    trainer = {
        'model': {
            'num_layers': 5   
        }
    }


@ex.capture
def get_trainer(trainer):
    """This is a captured function. Its arguments are filled with the 
    configuration values by sacred. It can be called without providing arguments
    within a sacred experiment.
    """
    # The following line creates the trainer from the configuration using 
    # classmethods provided by the Configurable class
    return pt.Trainer.from_config(trainer)


@ex.command(unobserved=True)
def init(_config, _run):
    """Custom commands can be defined with the `command` decorator.
    This custom command can be run with `python experiment.py init`. 

    This command creates a storage directory and saves all information required

    """
    # Print the configuration with marked modifications
    print_config(_run)

    # Save the configuration so that we can easily run the experiment
    pt.io.dump_config(
        _config, Path(_config['trainer']['storage_dir']) / 'config.json'
    )


@ex.automain
def main(_config, _run):
    """This is the main function of your experiment. It receives all 
    configuration values set in `config` as parameters. `_config` contains the  
    whole configuration as a dictionary and `_run` the current `Run` object."""

    # Print the configuration with marked modifications
    print_config(_run)
    
    # Construct the trainer with a captured function. Note that we don't pass 
    # arguments to the function, they are automatically filled by sacred.
    trainer = get_trainer()

    # This stores the configuration in the way it is expected by the model 
    # loading functions in padertorch (pt.Model.from_storage_dir)
    pt.io.dump_config(_config, trainer.storage_dir / 'config.json')
    
    # Run your experiment, start the training or do whatever you want here...
    # For example, start training
    train_dataset = ...
    trainer.train(
        train_dataset,
        # If the checkpoint directory already exists, we probably want to resume
        # instead of starting a new training 
        resume=(trainer.storage_dir / 'checkpoints').exists()
    )
```

You can initialize your experiment directory by calling `python experiment.py init`.
This additionally prints the configuration.
Note how `pt.io.get_new_storage_dir` created a new unused experiment dir and how `pt.Trainer.get_config` filled in the
 configuration values that we didn't specify.
In a colored terminal you can see which values were added and
  modified compared to the default configuration (i.e., defined by the config scope).

```bash
$ python experiment.py init
INFO - my-experiment-name - Running command 'init'
INFO - my-experiment-name - Started
Configuration (modified, added, typechanged, doc):
  """
  This function contains the configuration of the experiment. All local 
  variables in this function will be captured by sacred and used as 
  configuration values.
  """
  seed = 547702770                   # the random seed for this experiment
  trainer:                           # later
    checkpoint_trigger = [1, 'epoch']
    factory = 'padertorch.train.trainer.Trainer'
    loss_weights = None
    stop_trigger = [1, 'epoch']
    storage_dir = '/your/storage/root/my-experiment-name/1'
    summary_trigger = [1, 'epoch']
    virtual_minibatch_size = 1
    model:
      factory = 'MyModel'
      num_layers = 2
    optimizer:
      amsgrad = False
      betas = [0.9, 0.999]
      eps = 1e-08
      factory = 'padertorch.train.optimizer.Adam'
      gradient_clipping = 10000000000.0
      lr = 0.001
      weight_decay = 0
INFO - my-experiment-name - Completed after 0:00:00
```

Once you initialized the experiment's storage directory with the `init` command, you can start the experiment by
 calling:

```
$ python experiment.py with /path/to/the/experiment/storage/dir/config.json
```

### Accessing information stored by sacred and the Trainer

In addition to the information stored by the `FileStorageObserver`, the `pt.Trainer` stores training checkpoints.
The resulting structure looks like this:

```
.                       # The storage dir
├── config.json         # Config saved by ourselves for pt.Model.from_storage_dir
├── checkpoints         # This directory contains the model and trainer checkpoints
│   ├── ckpt_<iteration_number>.pth
│   ├── ckpt_best_loss.pth  # Symlink to best checkpoint judged by validation loss
│   └── ckpt_latest.pth     # Symlink to latest checkpoint 
└── sacred              # Sub-folder for the FileStorageObserver
    ├── 1               # A Unique ID created by the observer to handle multipe runs in the same storage dir (e.g., resume)
    │   ├── config.json     # Configuration of this run
    │   ├── cout.txt        # Captured stdout and stderr streams
    │   ├── metrics.json    # Reported metrics (not used by the trainer, so this file is typically empty)
    │   └── run.json        # Information about the run, such as time, host info, git status, imported packages ...
    └── _sources                  # The _sources folder can contain source files that are not checked into git
        └── experiment_544d3ddcc21032c781ad70f6aa728f18.py
```

Once you created and trained a model with a script similar to the above example, you can easily access the trained
 model with:
 
```python
import padertorch as pt
model = pt.Model.from_storage_dir('/path/to/the/storage/dir')
```

Note that we have to save the configuration manually for this to work because the `FileStorageObserver` doesn't save
 the configuration in a fixed folder.
